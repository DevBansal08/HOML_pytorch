    "- many ML probelms involve thousands or even millions of features for each training instance which makes it harder and extremely slow to find a good solution. This is called the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Warning :** reducing dimesionality can also drop some useful information just like compressing an image to JPEG can degerade its quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- apart from speeding up training and possibly improving our model's preformance , dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful in data visualisation. Reducing the number of dimensions down to two or three makes it possible to plot a condensed view of a high dimensional training set on a graph and often gain some important insights by visually detecting patterns such as clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "- in this chapter we'll go through three of the most popular dimensionality reductionn techniques:\n",
    "    1. PCA\n",
    "    2. random projection\n",

    "high dimensional datasets are often very sparse : most training instances are likely to be far away from each other, so training methods based on distance or similarity such as k nearest neighbours will be much less effective and some types of models will not be usable at all because they scale poorly with the dataset's dimensionality ( eg SVM or dense neural networks)\n"
